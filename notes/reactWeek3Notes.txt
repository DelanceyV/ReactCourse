Object Destructuring / Destructuring Assignment Syntax 

- Introduced in ES6 
- shortcut for accessing properties inside objects, or items inside arrays, then assigning them as values of new variables
    
    function logHotelInfo2({id, name, city}) {
        console.log(`${id}: ${name} located in ${city}.`);}

    is the same as ...

    function logHotelInfo1(hotel) {
        const id = hotel.id;
        const name = hotel.name;
        const city = hotel.city;
        console.log(`${id}: ${name} located in ${city}.`);

container components - fat / smart / stateful
    - fetch and manage state data
    - pass data to presentational components for rendering
    - do not render UI

Presentational Components - skinny / dumb / stateless
    - render UI - markup, styles - based on props passed to them
    - do not maintain their own state - only light UI state if any
